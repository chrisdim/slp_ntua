# [ECE NTUA] Speech &amp; Natural Language Processing
Lab Projects &amp; Theoretical Problems of the Speech &amp; Natural Language Processing course held by ECE - NTUA during the Fall Semester of 2020-2021.

# Lab Projects

## 1st Lab Exercise: Introduction to Language Representations
The first part involves the creation of an English language Spellchecker using simple language models, based on OpenFST transducers enriched with language informartion. In the second part, pretrained word embeddings (Word2Vec Model, GloVe Embeddings) are used for the creation of a sentiment classifier on text comments found in IMBD.

## 2nd Lab Exercise: Speech Recognition with Kaldi Toolkit
An Automatic Speech Recognition System on USC-TIMIT recordings is implemented using the open-source toolkit **Kaldi**. Steps include the extraction of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, the creation of language models from given transcriptions, the training of the acoustic model and finally the implementation of the final ASR system.
