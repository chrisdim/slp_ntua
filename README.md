The first part involves the creation of an English language Spellchecker using simple language models, based on OpenFST transducers enriched with language informartion. In the second part, pretrained word embeddings (Word2Vec Model, GloVe Embeddings) are used for the creation of a sentiment classifier for text comments found in IMBD.

## 2nd Lab Exercise: Speech Recognition with Kaldi Toolkit
An Automatic Speech Recognition System for USC-TIMIT recordings is implemented using the open-source toolkit **Kaldi**. Steps include the extraction of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, the creation of language models from given transcriptions, the training of the acoustic model and finally the implementation of the final ASR system.

## 3rd Lab Exercise: RNNs/LSTMs for Sentiment Analysis
Involves the implementation of Deep Learning algorithms with pretrained GloVe embeddings for text sentiment classification on real-life Tweets. Technologies explored: Deep Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networs, LSTMs, Transfer Learning and Attention Mechanisms.
